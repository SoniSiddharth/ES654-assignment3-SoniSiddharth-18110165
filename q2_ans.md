# Regularized Logistic Regression

## L1 Regularization and Important features

-- Accuracy with L1 regularization is -->  0.968365553602812

-- Important features after L1 regularization are -->  0, 5, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20
-- These features are chosen based on theta values greater than (mean + deviation/2).

## L2 Regularization 

-- Accuracy with L2 regularization is -->  0.968365553602812

## Nested Cross Validation for Lambda

-- Lambda values varied from 0.1 to 800.0
-- Best Lambda for L1 norm is 20.0 with accuracy of 0.9526
-- Best Lambda for L2 norm is 20.0 with accuracy of 0.9473
